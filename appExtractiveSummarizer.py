The passage of time has changed the source of books that can be read online in the form of electronic format where users only need to use a mobile device via the Internet. Books consist of various types of genres that are categorized into two namely fiction and non-fiction. Fiction books refer to literary plots, background, and characters designed and created from the writer’s imagination. Based on term of book sales in Malaysia, fiction books are more popular among readers than non-fiction book.

The Repetitive Neural Network (RNN) is the model that will be used to generate the summary. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is the most common architectures for Neural Text Summarization.
